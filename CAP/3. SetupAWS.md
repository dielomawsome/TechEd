# AWS CodeJam 

In this section of the CodeJam you're going to extend the application that you built this morning. 
There are two separated parts for this session.
First, you're going to add the ability to add an attachment to the records you create in the BTP Application. These attachments will be stored in Amazon Simple Storage Services (a.k.a. S3), which is a realiable and cost effective object store service. 
In order to do this, you will create an S3 Bucket (Buckets are object containers), then you will create a Role to provide access to the S3 Bucket and finally an API which will allow you to interact with the S3 bucket from the BTP Application. 

## Part 1 - Attach a document

### Step 1 - Create S3 Bucket

The first step is to create an S3 bucket. There are a number of options available for S3 buckets, including cross region replication, versioning as well as events and notifications. For now you're going to go with a basic setup. 

<details>
1. Access S3 Console

Enter S3 in the search bar and select S3 from the dropdown menu.

![Alt text](../images/image.png)

2. Create bucket

On the main S3 console, click on the Crate bucket button on the right

![Alt text](../images/image-100.png)

3. Enter bucket name

Enter a bucket name. The bucket name needs to be unique across all AWS accounts. 

A good idea would be to call it <your_name-teched-codejam>.

![Alt text](../images/image-2.png)

4. Scroll down and click on Create bucket

![Alt text](../images/image-3.png)

5. Access the S3 bucket to retrieve the bucket resource name

This will be required on a subsequent step, when we need to provide authorise our API to access to the S3 Bucket
Click on the bucket name on the list

![Alt text](../images/image-4.png)

6. Select Properties

![Alt text](../images/image-5.png)

7. Copy the Amazone Resource Name (ARN)

Clicking on the button to the left of the name will copy the ARN.

![Alt text](../images/image-6.png)

That's the S3 bucket created. 
</details>

### Step 2 - Setup IAM Role

Next you will need to create a policy to provide access to your S3 bucket and assign this to a Role that you will also create. You will use this role later on when creating the API. 


<details>
1. Access IAM console

On the search bar, type IAM (Identity Access Management), and select IAM from the menu.

![Alt text](../images/image-7.png)

2. Create Policy

Select policies from the left side panel

 ![Alt text](../images/image-8.png)
 
Click on the Create policy button

 ![Alt text](../images/image-9.png)


Switch the policy editor to JSON clicking on the button 

![Alt text](../images/image-10.png)

Copy and paste the following policy in the Policy Editor.
Replace the resource with the ARN you copied before, or just replace the <your_bucket> text with the name of your bucket (without <>). Ensure that the /* are included at the end of the ARN.
This policy enables access to read and write objects from your S3 bucket as well as listing objects within the bucket. 

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"		
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<your_bucket>/*"
        }
}
```

![Alt text](../images/image-11.png)

Click next and enter a policy name

![Alt text](../images/image-12.png)

Scroll down and click Create policy

![Alt text](../images/image-13.png)

You can now search and see your policy.

![Alt text](../images/image-14.png)

3. Create Role

Select the Roles menu entry from the side panel

![Alt text](../images/image-15.png)

Click Create role

![Alt text](../images/image-16.png)

On the next screen, select Custom trust policy. This will enable the role we're creating to be used by our API. The action sts:AssumeRole allows a service or instance to adopt a role while it is performing an action. The service "apigateway.amazonaws.com" specifies that we're allowing the API Gateway service to use this role. 
Copy the following code and paste it on the Custom trust policy section
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
        "Sid": "",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
            "Service": "apigateway.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
} 
```

![Alt text](../images/image-17.png)

Scroll down and click Next

![Alt text](../images/image-18.png)

On the next screen, you will add the policy you just created to this role. Search for the policy and select it using the checkbox next to the name. Click Next. 

![Alt text](../images/image-19.png)

Enter a name for your role

![Alt text](../images/image-20.png)

Scroll down and click Create role

![Alt text](../images/image-21.png)

4. Get Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the role.

This will be required for to create the API. Search for your role and click on the name.

![Alt text](../images/image-22.png)

Copy the ARN. You can click on the button on the left to do so. 

![Alt text](../images/image-23.png)

</details>

### Step 3 - Create API in API Gateway

The next step is to create an API to access the S3 bucket. 
We will enable the option to save and read files from S3.
This is done by implementing the PUT and GET methods.

<details>


1. Access API Gateway

Search for API Gateway and click on the service on the menu

![Alt text](../images/image-24.png)


2.	Select **REST API - Build**

On the API Gateway screen, scroll down to REST API

![Alt text](../images/aws-21.png)

4.	Create Resource **{folder}**.  

Ensure you enter **{folder}** for the **Resource Name** and **Resource Path** field.  


![Alt text](../images/aws-22.png)

![Alt text](../images/image-14.png)

5.	Create resource **{item}** under {folder}. 

Ensure you enter **{item}** for both the **Resource Name** and **Resource Path** field. 

![Alt text](../images/image-15.png)

![Alt text](../images/image-16-2.png)

Path override: {bucket}/{object}
Execution Role: resource name for the role created in the previous section.
```

![Alt text](../images/aws-28.png)

9.	In the next screen select **Integration Request**.

We need to map the path (bucket/object) to the resources we created (folder/item)
    
![Alt text](../images/aws-29.png)
    
10.	Expand URL Path Parameters and select Add path.

![Alt text](../images/image-300.png)
    
Please note that when enabling CORS, the Method Response and Integration Responses will be updated and an entry for Access-Control-Allow-Origin added. No action is required but you will notice this as an additional value.

21.	Click on Settings on the left side to configure the Binary Media Types supported.

    ![Alt text](../images/aws-37.png)

### SAP BTP App Modifications - Shaun
1. Add button to add attachment
Is a popup screen needed?
Add a field on the DB to store attachment details so it can be retrieved. 
3. Call API Put
4. Add button to retrieve attachment
5. Call API Get

## Part 2 - Find a solution using Amazon Bedrock

In the second step you're going to call a pre-defined API to find a solution for the incidents you create in your BTP application.
The API provided below will receive a question (in the body of the call) and will first perform an internet search for a solution and provide a step by step set of instructions for you to solve your problem. This API leverages the Generative AI capability provided by Amazon Bedrock and the Anthropic Claude Foundation Model. 

### API Details:

https://w2n1b8qko7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/fix

### Body:

```
{
	"Question" : "<TITLE OF THE INCIDENT FROM BTP>"
}
```
